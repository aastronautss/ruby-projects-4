# ruby-projects-4
Fourth bach of ruby projects built for the Odin Project, focusing on serialization and file I/O.

## Warmup Project: Event Manager

Use the CSV module, ERB package, and Sunlight API to create an HTML form letter inviting entrants in a CSV file to call their congresspeople.

## Project: Hangman

Decide on parameters to select a random word from a file and have the user play a game of hangman in the command line. Use the YAML library to add save/load functionality.

This was made as an extension of TurnGame from ruby-projects-3, and everything will be consolidated in a branching of that repo.
